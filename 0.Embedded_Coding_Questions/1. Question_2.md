## Design aligned Malloc fucntion
Designing an aligned malloc-like function in the Linux kernel involves allocating memory with a specified alignment. This is not the same as user-space malloc; instead, in the kernel, you typically use functions like kmalloc, kzalloc, vmalloc, etc., depending on your requirements.

However, kmalloc() in the kernel does support power-of-two alignment up to the size of the allocation. For more control, especially if you need a specific alignment (e.g., 64-byte, 4KB, etc.), youâ€™ll need to implement your own aligned allocator.

âœ… Use Case: Custom aligned_malloc() in Linux Kernel

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Implement a kernel function that:

- Allocates a memory buffer of size size
- Ensures the buffer is aligned to alignment bytes (must be a power of 2)
- Returns the pointer
- Frees properly when needed
