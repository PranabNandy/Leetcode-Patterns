## Tips 1
- Sometimes we have to reverse the edges directions
- Then compute the indegree + BFS / DFS

## Tips3
- Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using BFS **( Khan's Algo)**
- Don't do a step jump
- First collect indegree[V] then do **bfs / dfs**
``` c++
    for(int nei_node:adj[curr_node]){
           // --indegree[nei_node];
            if(!--indegree[nei_node])
                q.push(nei_node);
            
        }
```

## Tips 4
- Visited marking is done too late
- **`It causes test cases to fail`**
- So do it as early as possible

## Tips 5
- This is one of the approach for DAG with weight
- Use **`dist[V]`** and `BFS`

## Tips 6
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- It is an undirected graph ( can be cyclic too)
- The above DAG approach also worked
- Here, the Priority Queue is Important
- With Queue, so many repeated paths are coming, which are redundant. 
- It will end up with a higher execution time

## Tips 7
- We can use Dijstra ALgo when `Source` And `Destination` is given is **weights.**
- We can use it for no of ways also

## Tips 8
- Dijkstra will fail for **Negative Edges**
- It is for one source to one destination
- What if I have one source to all destination
- `Bellman Ford (BF)`
- It helps to detect the **Negetive edge cycle**
- `Iterate all the edges N-1 times` and update the Dist array
- Then at Nth iteration, if Dist array still getting updated, then Graph contains Negetive Edge cycle
- 

## Tips 9
- Multi-Source and Multi-Destination
- It also detect the Negetive Cycle
- `Floyd Wardshall `

## Tips 10
- Disjkstra algo needs Priority Queue (minHeap -> greter<iii>)
- It needs **Distance[]** array
- Now we can also add **Ways[]** array --> It also `shortest distance` from **SRC** to `DST`

## Tips 11
- Disjkstra algo needs this format

## Tips 12
- Bellman Ford will only work if the graph is **Directed Graph**
- If undirected edges are given, convert it into directed edges.
