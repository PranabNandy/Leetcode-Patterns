## Tips 1
- Sometimes we have to reverse the edges directions
- Then compute the indegree + BFS / DFS

## Tips3
- Cycle Detection in Directed Graph using BFS **( Khan's Algo)**
- Don't do a step jump
- First collect indegree[V] then do **bfs / dfs**
``` c++
    for(int nei_node:adj[curr_node]){
           // --indegree[nei_node];
            if(!--indegree[nei_node])
                q.push(nei_node);
            
        }
```

## Tips 4
- Visited marking is done too late
- It causes test cases to fail
- SO do it as early as possible
