1. https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/
- We have to take subsequence
- So we can not use sorting
- Only dp is the option
- Can not use heap as **K elements** is mentioned as it will alter the order
- 
```c++
sort(vals.begin(), vals.end(),
             [&](auto x1, auto x2) { return x1.second > x2.second; });
```
- Now you use 2 technique
- Push everything in maxHeap, then a count for top K element, traverse the array and store those element present in heap
- Put array (ind, val) in array pair<int,int>
- Sort n elements basis of x.second;(val)
- then sort first k elements on basis of x.first (index)
- Then just put those elements in the final vector


2. https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/

- Here max 2 consecutive integer has to be there ( 1,2,3,---> X Not possible)
- SO order of those 2 interger does not matter
- As it subsequence
- Sort it() then 2 pointer

3. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/

- In case of subsequence problem where it is mentioned that
- **In a subsequence, max and min element**
- `Then we can sort the array`
- arr=[5, 1 , 4, 10, 1, 6 , 5]
- subsequence = { 5,4,6,5} max=6 min=4
- Now just rearrange the subsequence = { 4,5,5,6 } still max=6 min=4
- Now lets sort the array = [1,1,4,5,5,6,10] ==> subsequence={4,5,5,6}
