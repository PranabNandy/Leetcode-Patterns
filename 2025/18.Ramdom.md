1. https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/
- We have to take subsequence
- So we can not use sorting
- Only dp is the option
- Can not use heap as **K elements** is mentioned as it will alter the order
- 
```c++
sort(vals.begin(), vals.end(),
             [&](auto x1, auto x2) { return x1.second > x2.second; });
```
- Now you use 2 technique
- Push everything in maxHeap, then a count for top K element, traverse the array and store those element present in heap
- Put array (ind, val) in array pair<int,int>
- Sort n elements basis of x.second;(val)
- then sort first k elements on basis of x.first (index)
- Then just put those elements in the final vector


2. https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/

- Here max 2 consecutive integer has to be there ( 1,2,3,---> X Not possible)
- SO order of those 2 interger does not matter
- As it subsequence
- Sort it() then 2 pointer
