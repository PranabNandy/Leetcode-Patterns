1.  Benefit of using Yocto over any other build tools
    >A> 
    Architecture agnostic
    supports partial build
    Uses a layer model, so development parallelism can be achieve
    easily build stripped images for constrained embedded and IoT devices
    comprehensive toolchain large support & ecosystem 
2.  What is Open-Embedded & poky in Yocto?
    >A>
	Open-Embedded: Open source build engine
    poky: Open source reference embedded distribution
3.  Difference between DEPENDS & RDEPENDS?
4.  What is shared state cache in yocto?
    >A>  Stores build generated intermediate files to speed up build process
5.  What do u mean by task, function & class in yocto recipe?
6.  What is PN in gstreamer1.0-plugins-good_1.16.3.bb?  
7.  What is PV in Yocto? 
8.  What is SRC_URI & FILESEXTRAPATHS? 
9.  What is WORKDIR? 
    >A>  Directory where bitbake compiles & build package. 
10. What is S variable?
    >A>  Directory where yocto unpack the source code. e.g. for git it is S = ${WORKDIR}/git 
11. What is D variable?
    >A>  Directory where components are installed by do_install task. e.g. Default it'll be at ${WORKDIR}/image 
12. What is AUTOREV?
    >A>  Takes latest source revision from repo 
13. Difference between SRC_URI += and SRC_URI_append(override style)?
    >A>  In append no additional space is added, just concatenating strings, while += adds additional space between strings.
    override style provides guaranteed operations. (+= does not append variable defined in class, while override style does) 
14. What's the meaning of var ?= val 
15. Set the default value of var to val. 
16. Role of pkg-config
    >A>  The primary use of pkg-config is to provide the necessary details for compiling and linking a program to a library. This metadata is stored in pkg-config files. 
17. What is .bb and .bbappend file 
18. Selecting particular version of a recipe
    >A>  Using PREFREED_VERSION_recipename = "x.x.x"
