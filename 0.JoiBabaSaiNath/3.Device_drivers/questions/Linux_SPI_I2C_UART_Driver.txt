1. What is the difference between I2C & SPI
2. How will you chosse which protocal to be used on board communication
3. How the communication difference b/w I2C & SPI
4. Is clock stretching is for Master or Slave in I2C protocol
5. What is Bit Binding in I2C protocol
6. What is i2c clock stretching
7. what is repeate sequence in I2C? How this signal will look on CRO?
8. How will you know if the I2C lines are noisy?
9. What monitoring tools have you used like I2C sniffer
10. how will you verify I2C communication?How will you know if there was a software or hw problem?
11. what is i2c bus error
12. I2C- dummy write, repeated start, arbitration, synchronization between masters
13. Lm475 temperature driver project
14. How can two slaves can communicate with master in i2c protocol at a time?
15. How can we address different devices from same vendor i2c?
16. What is the clock frequency used in your I2C driver designed?
17. What is the start bit condition in I2C?
18. How I2C protocol works?
19. What are different speeds the I2C had?
20. How the master knows what is the start condition ?
21. while in between I2C communication what happens if clocks happens to be dragged low which is not as per i2c standard?
22. What if the slave device is not responding or no acknowledge bit is sent by slave device?
23. I2C : what is I2C Clock Stretch, Bus line clear.
24. How many lines required for SPI communication?
25. Do you need to change Clock polarity and phase for SPI?
26. Who has control of SPI clock?
27. Diff btwn SPI & I2C
