1. Different types of IPC mechanisms:
   >A> Signals, Pipes, Socket, Message Queues, Semaphores, Shared memory
2. What are necessary conditions which can lead to a deadlock situation in a system?
   >A> Deadlock situations occur when four conditions occur simultaneously in a system:
       Mutual exclusion; Hold and Wait; No preemption; and Circular wait.
3. What are real-time systems?
   >A> Real-time systems are used when rigid time requirements have been placed on the operation of a processor.
       It has well defined and fixed time constraints.
4. What is time- sharing system?
   In a Time-sharing system, the CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them, also known as multitasking.
   This process happens so fast that users can interact with each program while it is running.
5. Synchronization mechanisms inside Linux kernel
6. Race condition and deadlock
7. atomic operations
8. Semaphores
9. spin-lock , in single processer?
10. Mutex and Semaphore
11. Threads and process
    11.1. Process vs thread ? when to use which ?
12. Multutasking and multithreading
13. Scheduling mechanism and types
14. client and server socket init
15. when to use message queues and socket
16. can we use pipe on different machine
17. in which IPC shared memory be used?
18. For communication between threads why we should use IPC, instead of global variables?
19. What are differences between process vs thread? How to decide using process or thread? Any tradeoff? Give me an example?
20. What are differences between semaphore vs mutex? Protect sharing resources? Signaling and synchronization?
21. What is dead-lock? How to avoid it?
22. difference between poll and select.
23. What are spin locks, are they better then mutex ?
24. What are the differences between spinlock and mutex?
