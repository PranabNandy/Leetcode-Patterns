1. What is difference between YUV and RGB ?  Why there will be need of YUV color format apart from RGB?
   >A>
   YUV: support different modes:
        Packed: One memory region storing all components (Y, U and V)
        Semiplanar: One memory region for Y component and one for UV components
        Planar: One memory region for each component
    Each memory region storing a frame component (Y, U or V) is called a plane
2. NTSC, PAL, SD, HD, Full HD, 4K, DCI 4K and 8K – Give me exact width x height for each one.
3. Difference between NTSC and PAL , 4K and DCI4K resolutions. ?
4. Progressive vs Interlaced scanning
5. Chrominance and luminance
6. What are various image formats? What are 4:4:4, 4:2:2 etc. Sampling ?
7. What are different color spaces like RGB, YUV ? How would YUV pixel values look like for a green,
   blue, red, black and white color pixels for suppose 8 bit per color space?

10. Video formats and its understanding: e.g. NV12/YUV420 - How pixels are arranged
11. YUV420, YUV422, YUV444 chroma subsampling schemes understanding and single frame size calculation
    >A>
    YUV420 - 1 Cb & 1 Cr samples per 4 luma samples
    YUV422 - 2 Cb & 2 Cr samples per 4 luma samples
    YUV444 - 4 Cb & 4 Cr samples per 4 luma samples

    Size of 1920 * 1080
    YUV420 8-bit ==> 1920 * 1080 * (1 + 2/4) ==> 1920 * 1080 * 1.5
    YUV422 8-bit ==> 1920 * 1080 * (1 + 4/4) ==> 1920 * 1080 * 2
    YUV444 8-bit ==> 1920 * 1080 * (1 + 8/4) ==> 1920 * 1080 * 3
12. What is I, P, B frames
13. Difference between codec and container
14. What's the purpose of encoding & decoding video?
15. What is stride in video ?
    >A>
    The stride or pitch is the number of bytes from the first pixel of a line to the first pixel of
    the next line of video. In the simplest case, the stride equals the width multiplied by the bits
    per pixel, converted to bytes. For example, AR24 requires 32 BPP which is four bytes per pixel.
    A video buffer with an active area of 1920 x 1080 pixels therefore has a stride of 4 x 1920 = 7,680 bytes.
16. What is PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio)  ?
17. HDR/HDR10, HDR10+, HLG
18. Advantage of yuv over RGB format
19. What is VSync (Vertical sync) in the context of video bus timing diagram?
    >A>
    The synchronization signal that marks the end of a frame and the beginning of the next frame
    vertically. It helps maintain proper timing and synchronization between the display and the
    video source
20. What is HSync (Horizontal sync) in the context of video bus timing diagram?
    >A>
    The synchronization signal that marks the end of a line and the beginning of the next line
    horizontally within a frame. It ensures proper scanning and synchronization of the video signal
21. What is VActive (Vertical active) in the context of video bus timing diagram?
    >A>
    The portion of a frame where the actual image or content is displayed vertically. It represents
    the height of the visible area on the screen where the video or graphics are actively displayed
22. What is HActive (Horizontal active) in the context of video bus timing diagram?
    >A>
    The portion of a line where the actual image or content is displayed horizontally. It represents
    the width of the visible area on the screen where the video or graphics are actively displayed.
23. What is VBlank (Vertical blank) in the context of video bus timing diagram?
    >A>
    The period between frames where no content is displayed vertically. It occurs after the VActive
    portion and provides time for the display to reset, perform any necessary adjustments, and
    prepare for the next frame. Page-flipping typically occurs during the this time interval.
24. What is HBlank (Horizontal blank) in the context of video bus timing diagram?
    >A>
    The period between lines where no content is displayed horizontally. It occurs after the HActive
    portion within each line and allows time for the display to reset and prepare for the next line
25. Front Porch & Back Porch
    >A>
    - The back porch is the interval in a video signal that follows the active display area (HActive
      or VActive) and precedes the synchronization signal (HSync or VSync). It represents a blanking
      period where no video information is transmitted.
    - During the back porch, the display hardware
      typically performs tasks such as resetting or adjusting for the next line or frame.
    - The front porch is the interval in a video signal that precedes the active display area
      (HActive or VActive) and follows the synchronization signal (HSync or VSync). Similar to
      the back porch, it also represents a blanking period.
    - During the front porch, the display hardware prepares for the next line or frame, such as adjusting
      circuitry or stabilizing voltages.
