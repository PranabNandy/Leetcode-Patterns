Other questions:

Structure packing: How does this differ in 8-bit architecture vs 32 bit? Can you save space by packing structures differently? Think about word alignment (and what a 'word' means in different architectures).

Reverse a byte (or arbitrary length integer) in a function.

Find if a string is a palindrome.

Find if a point is within a given circle of radius R and offset x and y.

Optimize. Floating point math is costly. Math calls like sqrt are costly. What are some cases that you could use to escape the function early?

Have some basic knowledge of RTOSes. What is a mutex? What is a semaphore? How are they different?

What does it mean for a function to be reentrant? When would you avoid a non-reentrant function?

Basic knowledge of all common communication protocols: SPI, UART, I2C. How do you calculate the baud rate of a UART connection? What are the RTX and CTX pins used for? For SPI, what are some common ways a master and a slave could fail to communicate (think about how SPI settings could be different). For I2C, what happens if you fail to have sufficient pull-ups? When would you want to use SPI over I2C?

What is a DMA, and when would you want to use one?

Knowledge of how a SAR ADC works.

Basic EE stuff like - how does a capacitor influence a circuit? How about an inductor? Using a transistor as an amplifier in its linear range, basic kirchoff's law, ampere's law stuff as well.

Also, know basic op-amp circuits - inverting and non-inverting with basic resistive feedback. Beyond that would probably be a reach.

Edit: I will say that all of these are questions that I've been asked during interviews as an embedded engineer, including some of the questions from the 0x10 link I gave at the top of this post.
