1. Implement a tic-tac-toe game for single player
2. sudoku puzzle: Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array sudoku[9][9], the goal is to assign
   digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size
   3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.
3. An expression will be given which can contain open and close parentheses and optionally
   some characters, No other operator will be there in string. We need to remove minimum number
   of parentheses to make the input string valid. If more than one valid output are possible
   removing same number of parentheses then print all such output
   Input: str = "()())()" -
   Output : ()()()
            (())()
   Input: str = "(()"
   Output : ()
4. Given a number n, the task is to generate n bit Gray codes. i.e. generate bit patterns from
   0 to 2^n-1 such that successive patterns differ by one bit)
   Input : 2
   Output : 0 1 3 2
   Explanation : 00 -> 01 -> 11 -> 10
   Input : 3
   Output : 000 -> 001 -> 011 -> 010 -> 110 -> 111 -> 101 -> 100
